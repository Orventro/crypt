# crypt
This program encrypts and decrypts data.
You will decrypt file only if you type same seed as for encrypting it.
I will add GUI soon.

To use it, you need to compile it first.
## How to compile:
```
g++ -o crypt crypt.cpp 
```
## How to use:

Run program with this command:
```
./crypt 'e or d' 'file name' 'seed'
```
note:
'e or d' - mean encrypt(e) or decrypt(d)
